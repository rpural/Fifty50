# Fifty50
A ticketless 50/50 raffle drawing

written for iOS / iPadOS Pythonista app

In a traditional 50/50 raffle
drawing, tickets are sold at
a fixed price to a limited group
of people (within a club, team,
family reunion,...), and at
a specific time, sales are 
closed and kne ticket is drawn
and the winner receives half of
the proceeds. The other half
goes to the club or charity. 

Then, all the tickets are thrown
away, as they're no longer of
use. This seemed wasteful to
me. 

This program creates "virtual
tickets", and handles the
"drawing" using the random
number generator. No waste.
